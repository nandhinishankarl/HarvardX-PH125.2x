Titanic Survival Exercises

Put all your new skills together to perform exploratory data analysis on a classic machine learning dataset: 
Titanic survival!
Background

The Titanic was a British ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 from the 
United Kingdom to New York. More than 1,500 of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died in the accident,
 making this one of the largest maritime disasters ever outside of war. The ship carried a wide range of 
passengers of all ages and both genders, from luxury travelers in first-class to immigrants in the lower 
classes. However, not all passengers were equally likely to survive the accident. We use real data about a 
selection of 891 passengers to learn who was on the Titanic and which passengers were more likely to survive.
Libraries, Options, and Data 

Be sure that you have installed the titanic package before proceeding.

Define the titanic dataset starting from the titanic library with the following code:

options(digits = 3)    # report 3 significant digits
library(tidyverse)
library(titanic)

titanic <- titanic_train %>%
    select(Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) %>%
    mutate(Survived = factor(Survived),
           Pclass = factor(Pclass),
           Sex = factor(Sex))
          
           
Question 1: Variable Types

Inspect the data and also use ?titanic_train to learn more about the variables in the dataset. Match these variables 
from the dataset to their variable type. There is at least one variable of each type (ordinal categorical, non-ordinal
categorical, continuous, discrete).

Survived (non-ordinal categorical)

Pclass  (ordinal categorical)

Sex  (non-ordinal categorical)

SibSp (discrete)

Parch  (discrete)

Fare (continuous)

Question 2: Demographics of Titanic Passengers
 
Make density plots of age grouped by sex. Try experimenting with combinations of faceting, alpha blending, stacking and using variable counts on the y-axis 
to answer the following questions. Some questions may be easier to answer with different versions of the density plot.

Which of the following are true?

1. Females and males had the same general shape of age distribution. TRUE
2. The age distribution was bimodal, with one mode around 25 years of age and a second smaller mode around 5 years of age. TRUE
3. There were more females than males. 
4. The count of males of age 40 was higher than the count of females of age 40. TRUE
5. The proportion of males age 18-35 was higher than the proportion of females age 18-35. TRUE
6. The proportion of females under age 17 was higher than the proportion of males under age 17. TRUE
7. The oldest passengers were female.

Code and explanation:

1. titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2) +
    facet_grid(Sex ~ .)
    
Both genders have similar age distributions with similar shapes. A faceted plot can be used to compare the distributions. 
    
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2, position = "stack")
 
A stacked density plot can be used to answer questions 2,3 and 4 with the count on the y-axis.
According to the plot, there are two modes at 5 years and 25 years of age hence, the age 
distribution is bimodal. 
There are more males than females which is indicated by a higher total area and the count of males at age 40 is higher than the count of females at age 40. 
    

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
    
An alpha blended density plot with the fill as "Sex" gives the answers for 5,6 and 7. 
It can be observed from the plot that in the age range of 18-35, the proportion of males was higher than that of females and the proportion of females 
under 17 was higher than that of males under 17.
The proportion of males above the age of 55 is higher than that of females, the oldest passengers were male.

Question 3: QQ-plot of Age Distribution


Use geom_qq() to make a QQ-plot of passenger age and add an identity line with geom_abline(). Filter out any individuals
with an age of NA first. Use the following object as the dparams argument in geom_qq():
 
params <- titanic %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    summarize(mean = mean(Age), sd = sd(Age))

Answer: 

titanic %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(sample = Age)) +
    geom_qq(dparams = params) +
    geom_abline()
    
Question 4: Survival by Sex


To answer the following questions, make barplots of the Survived and Sex variables using geom_bar(). Try plotting one variable and filling by the other variable. 
You may want to try the default plot, then try adding position = position_dodge() to geom_bar() to make separate bars for each group.

You can read more about making barplots in the textbook section on ggplot2 geometries.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.Less than half of passengers survived. CORRECT
2.Most of the survivors were female. CORRECT
3.Most of the males survived. 
4.Most of the females survived. CORRECT
 
Questions 1 and 2 can be answered with the help of a bar plot of survival status filled by sex. 
According to this plot, the count of non survivors is higher than the count of survivors. 
In the "survived" bar, more than half of the survivors were female. 

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar()

The bars of the plot can be split by Sex with position_dodge. The "Female" survived bar has a greater height than the "Male" survived bar.

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
    
The bar plot of Sex filled by Survival status can be used to answer questions 3 and 4. It indicates that most of the females survived.  

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Sex, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar()
    

Question 5: Survival by Age
 
Make a density plot of age filled by survival status. Change the y-axis to count and set alpha = 0.2.
Which age group is the only group more likely to survive than die?
0-8
10-18
18-30
30-50
50-70
70-80
Asnwer: 0-8

Which age group had the most deaths?
0-8
10-18
18-30
30-50
50-70
70-80
Answer: 18-30

Which age group had the highest proportion of deaths?
0-8
10-18
18-30
30-50
50-70
70-80
Answer: 70-80

Code:


titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
    
    
Question 6: Survival by Fare
 
Filter the data to remove individuals who paid a fare of 0. Make a boxplot of fare grouped by survival status. Try a log2
transformation of fares. Add the data points with jitter and alpha blending.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.Passengers who survived generally payed higher fares than those who did not survive. (CORRECT)
2.The interquartile range for fares was smaller for passengers who survived.
3.The median fare was lower for passengers who did not survive.(CORRECT)
4.Only one individual paid a fare around $500. That individual survived.
5.Most individuals who paid a fare around $8 did not survive.(CORRECT) 

Code:


titanic %>%
    filter(Fare > 0) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, Fare)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2)
   
   
 Question 7: Survival by Passenger Class
 
 The Pclass variable corresponds to the passenger class. Make three barplots. For the first, make a basic barplot of 
passenger class filled by survival. For the second, make the same barplot but use the argument position = position_fill()
to show relative proportions in each group instead of counts. For the third, make a barplot of survival filled by 
passenger class using position = position_fill().

Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.There were more third class passengers than passengers in the first two classes combined.(CORRECT)
2.There were the fewest passengers in first class, second-most passengers in second class, and most passengers
 in third class.
3.Survival proportion was highest for first class passengers, followed by second class. Third-class had the lowest 
 survival proportion.(CORRECT)
4.Most passengers in first class survived. Most passengers in other classes did not survive.(CORRECT)
5.The majority of survivors were from first class. (Majority means over 50%.)
6.The majority of those who did not survive were from third class.(CORRECT)

# Bar plot of passenger class filled by survival. 

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar() +
    ylab("Count")
   
# Bar plot of passenger class filled by survival with position_fill

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_fill()) +
    ylab("Proportion")

# Barplot of survival filled by passenger class with position_fill

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Pclass)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_fill()) +
    ylab("Proportion")

1.The largest group of passengers was third-class males. CORRECT
2.The age distribution is the same across passenger classes.
3.The gender distribution is the same across passenger classes. 
4.Most first-class and second-class females survived. CORRECT
5.Almost all second-class males did not survive, with the exception of children. CORRECT

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    facet_grid(Sex ~ Pclass)
